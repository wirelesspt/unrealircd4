# https://unrealircd.org/docs/Ban_version_block

# The ban version block allows you to ban a client based on the IRC client software they use. 
# This makes use of the clients CTCP version reply. Therefore if a client does not send out a CTCP version, the ban will not work. 
# This feature is intended to allow you to block malicious scripts.
